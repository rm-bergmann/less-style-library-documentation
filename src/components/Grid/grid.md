# CSS Grid Styles

### Apply these mixins to the grid container element

Default: 12 columns, 20px Gap, 1 row auto height

```CSS
.grid-container {
  #display.grid();
}
```

Maybe you want a 4 column grid, 40px gap, 4 rows, 40px row height

```CSS
#display.grid(4, 40px, 4, 40px);
```

Try a 16 column grid, 10px gap, 2 rows, 100px row height

```CSS
#display.grid(16, 10px, 2, 100px);
```

We can also justify content, justify items and align items all in the center like this:

```CSS
#display.grid(center, 16, 10px, 2, 100px);
```

You can also try stretch items

```CSS
#display.grid(stretch, 16, 10px, 2, 100px);
```

### Apply these grid mixins to the grid items inside the grid cotainer:

Default will start at column 1 and end at column 12.

```CSS
.grid-item {
  #grid.column();
}
```

You can customize your start / end points by specifying them.
Lets say we want to start at column 2 and end at column 4:

```CSS
  #grid.column(2, 4);
```

We can also specify the row start / row end like this:
Default will start at row 1 and end at row 2, but we can speficy any row start and end points:

```CSS
  #grid.row();
  #grid.row(3, 5);
```

If you want an element to span across the whole row from left to right use this mixin:

```CSS
  #grid.column(across);
```

If that does not work, you can specify how many columns to span by.
Default starts at column 1 and spans 12 columns.
You can speicfy the start columns and the amount of columns you want to span by. Lets start at column 2 and span 6:

```CSS
  #grid.column(span);
  #grid.column(span, 2, 6);
```

When designing responsive sites we may have columns stacked on top of eachother on mobile devices,
and beside eachother on tablet devices and desktop screens. I have designed some customizeable mixins which
do this work for you.

By default, on tablet and desktop devices we start at column 1 and span 2.
We can specify the start column and amount to span the element by. Lets start at column 6 and span 4:

```CSS
  #grid.column(responsive);
  #grid.column(responsive, 6, 4);
```

Useful mixin to change both Grid column and row gaps at the same time.
Both column and row gaps must have the same value.

```CSS
  #grid.gap(20px);
```
